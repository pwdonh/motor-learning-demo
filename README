This is a Psychopy demo task that I made for a class. It shows a reaching task under perturbation similar to what is often used in motor learning studies.

The easiest way to install Psychopy is in a conda environment that can be built using the provided .yml file like this:

```
conda env create -n psychopy -f psychopy-env.yml
```

The task can then be run like this:

```
conda activate psychopy
python reaching_task.py
```

There's some parameters to change the amount of perturbation (--theta), number of trials in the different periods (e.g. --num_training, --num_perturb, --num_washout)

It's also possible to introduce a certain amount of deviants into the regular sequence of reaching movements (--pdeviant: proportion of deviants).
